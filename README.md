### Hi there, 👋🏼

Nice to see you here.

I guess you got here through one of my blogs. If this is the case, thanks for reading it. It's essential to me that I'm writing relevant content.

In this repository, you can find the libraries that I tested or still testing. Feel free to explore. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to contact me. So far, I have tested `PyForest`, `LazyPredict`, `Lux`, `PyCaret`, `TextBlob`, `TPOT`, `QuickDA`, and some others.

You will see some other folders with other libraries that I am working on it. Soon, they will be good to go.

Any questions or suggestions? Reach me out on my **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismael-araujo/ "LinkedIn")**.

#### What I am up to:
Currently, I'm working on this cool library called `PyCarat`. I will publish it soon.

#### Blogs:

Here are some of my most popular blogs about these libraries are the following ones:
