### Hi there, 👋🏼

So nice to see you here. I will be using this repo to test new cool libraries. So far, I have tested `PyForest`, `LazyPredict`, and `Lux`.

Any questions? Reach me out on my **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismael-araujo/ "LinkedIn")**.

#### What I am up to:
Currently, I'm working on this cool library called `PyCarat`. I will soon public a blog about it.

#### Blogs:
**[How to Run 30 Machine Learning Models with 2 Lines of Code](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-run-30-machine-learning-models-with-2-lines-of-code-d0f94a537e52 "How to Run 30 Machine Learning Models with 2 Lines of Code")**

Learn how to run multiple machine learning models using lazy predict — code along

**[How to Import All Python Libraries With One Line of Code](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-import-all-python-libraries-with-one-line-of-code-2b9e66a5879f "How to Import All Python Libraries With One Line of Code")**

Learn how to import the 40 most important libraries using PyForest
